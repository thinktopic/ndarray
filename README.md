# ndarray

This library is a fork of [thi.ng.ndarray](https://github.com/thinktopic/ndarray)
Karsten Schmidt's Clojure/Clojurescript port of Mikola Lysenko's
[ndarray core](https://github.com/scijs/ndarray) JS library for
multidimensional arrays with almost zero-cost views, re-ordering,
skipping and extended features.

This library is primarily being developed as a Clojurescript implementation
of core.matrix.
